## Your starting point...
### js/helper.js
Within helper.js, you’ll find a large collection of strings containing snippets of HTML. Within many snippets, you’ll find placeholder data in the form of `%data%` or `%contact%`.

Each string has a title that describes how it should be used. For instance, `HTMLworkStart` should be the first `<div>` in the Work section of the resume. `HTMLschoolLocation` contains a `%data%` placeholder which should be replaced with the location of one of your schools.

### The resume has four distinct sections: 
work, education, projects and a header with biographical information.
